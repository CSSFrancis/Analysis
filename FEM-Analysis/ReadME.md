This notebook walks through how to preform an FEM analysis using hyperspy/pyxem.  The workflow might change slightly with 
time but for now it works, if fairly fast, and can accomplish most of the things necessary for one of these experiments

If you are interested or need further instrucution then you can always contact csfrancis@wisc.edu for
